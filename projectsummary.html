				<h2>description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to make a place where I could journal about all the yummy things I've eaten and sipped on in LA but also wherever I've traveled. I've formatted my code so that it's really easy to add new entries if I wish, but right now, the food drink sections each have 5 entries of recommendations/things I've tried. For each food or drink, I've given a rating out of 5 stars, and a price point out of 4 $'s. I'm hoping that people who visit my site will be able to get ideas of where they want to grab their next lunch, plan a dinner out, or find a cafe to study at!</p>

				<h2>extras</h2>

				<h3>transitions & transformations</h3>
				<p>I used transitions on each of my entries for the food/drink pages. When hovering over a rectangular entry, the box expands slightly with a smooth transition in between the original box size and new box size. This makes it feel like the entry is "popping" out so you only focus on that individual entry when you're reading.</p>

				<h3>jquery plugin</h3>
				<p>I found a plugin called jquery-typewriter by Chad Selph that could make text look like it were being typed out typewriter style, where you see each character appear one at a time. I applied this affect to the heading/main title of each page, so anything with an h1 tag. I think it makes me website feel more like a food diary/log, where I'm adding in whatever I'm feeling. Here's a link to the documentation: <a href="https://github.com/chadselph/jquery-typewriter.git" target="_blank">click me!</a></p>
